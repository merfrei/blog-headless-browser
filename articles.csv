"Food Stamps, Economy, Val Kilmer: Your Wednesday Evening Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest.ImageCredit...John G Mabanglo/EPA, via Shutterstock1. Nearly one in five young children in the U.S. are not getting enough to eat.That’s according to a new survey of households by the Brookings Institution, which found that 17.4 percent of children were not eating enough. That’s three times as high as in 2008, during the Great Recession.Disruptions in school meal programs during the pandemic may be part of the problem, the lead researcher said, with some families unable to reach distribution sites and older siblings at home competing for limited food. Above, a school lunch drop-off in Alameda, Calif., last week.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe findings come as Democrats seek to raise food stamp benefits for the duration of the economic crisis, and Republicans resist doing so.

President Trump said the White House coronavirus task force would “continue on indefinitely,” though perhaps with different members, reversing comments he made just a day earlier.“I thought we could wind it down sooner,” Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office on Wednesday at an event to honor National Nurses Day. “But I had no idea how popular the task force is until actually yesterday, when I started talking about winding it down.” (Watch the video.)In other news out of Washington, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos released final rules for campus sexual misconduct claims that bolster protections for the accused. Victims’ groups plan to sue.ImageCredit...Dmitry Kostyukov for The New York Times3. The European Union’s economy is on the verge of a depression, with investment expected to collapse and deficits to balloon, the European Union’s executive branch said.The E.U. economy is set to shrink 7.4 percent this year — more than during the Great Recession, when it shrank 4.5 percent. For some countries, like Italy, Spain and Greece, the projections go past 9 percent.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe consequences will ripple out: The bloc is a major trading partner for the U.S., China and other major economies.More bad news is expected on Friday, when the U.S. Labor Department releases unemployment numbers for the entire month of April. The figures will undoubtedly show the nation’s worst-ever job losses. But they could also provide key hints about recovery, like how many job losses are expected to be temporary.ImageCredit...Thoka Maer4. An anvil sitting on your chest. An alien takeover. A really long hangover.Our reporters talked to people who had Covid-19 and recovered. In vivid terms, they described what it was like.“Nothing in my body felt like it was working,” said a 43-year-old woman who owns a public relations firm. “I felt so beat up, like I had been in a boxing ring with Mike Tyson.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyBut there may be hope from an unexpected source. Antibodies from a 4-year-old llama in Belgium, named Winter, may lead scientists to a protective treatment against the coronavirus. Llamas produce a special kind of antibody and have long been a part of virus studies.ImageCredit...Leila Navidi/Star Tribune, via Associated Press5. A new survey suggests that women are disproportionately doing more unpaid labor these days, just as they did before the lockdown.Both men and women are doing more housework and child care now, the survey found, but the results suggest that they aren’t dividing the work any differently. And men and women see things differently: Nearly half of the men surveyed said they did most of home schooling. Only 3 percent of women agreed. Above, home school in Roseville, Minn.Many researchers and couples assumed women were bearing the brunt of the extra labor, but this is among the first efforts to quantify it at a national level.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyImageCredit...Shawn Poynter for The New York Times6. The urge to travel isn’t going anywhere.We examined how airlines, cruises, home sharing and parks will change in a post-pandemic world. Expect a boom in road trips, for example. Above, a flashback to a retired couple’s Tennessee stop in 2014.Across the board, experts highlighted issues of privacy and cleanliness, and the tug of wanting to explore but needing to stay safe. Here’s what to know about travel’s future.And what about the future of music clubs? Independent venues around the country are critical to local scenes and artists on the rise. With concerts on hold during the pandemic, they’re struggling to hang on.If you need a reminder of what an audience looks like, photographers shared their images of prequarantine crowds, when jamming together elbow to elbow felt normal.ImageCredit...Calla Kessler/The New York TimesAdvertisementContinue reading the main story7. Joe Biden’s lead on President Trump is growing nationwide, according to a new Monmouth University poll.All told, 50 percent of voters said they would vote for Mr. Biden and 41 percent said they would vote for Mr. Trump. It is the first major national survey to ask voters about the sexual-assault allegation by Tara Reade, a former Senate aide, against Mr. Biden. There was a large partisan divide in assessments of her credibility.Young Republicans largely dislike Mr. Trump, but one issue remains a powerful force pulling them toward the Republican Party: abortion.ImageCredit...NASA, ESA and D. Lin/University of New Hampshire8. Astronomers have spotted one of the rarest and most-sought creatures in the cosmic story: an intermediate-mass black hole.The word “intermediate” is a bit of a misnomer. This black hole is thousands or hundreds of thousands of times more massive than the sun. It’s just smaller than the better-known supermassive black holes, which weigh in at millions of billions of solar masses.The discovery sheds light on how the universe was assembled in the dark.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyImageCredit...Jeff Minton for The New York Times9. What happened to Val Kilmer? In a wide-ranging interview, we find out the actor is just starting to figure it out.Throat cancer has taken his voice, but his perpetual lesson rules supreme: If you have enough faith, destiny takes over. He spoke to Taffy Brodesser-Akner about his love for Mark Twain, dedication to Christian Science and the new roles coming his way (including a “Top Gun” revival).“I feel like I could not possibly be in a better place for attracting better and better roles,” he said.ImageCredit...Justin von Oldershausen for The New York Times10.

"A Moment of Calm With Jewel, and More Live Events This Week","The coronavirus has transformed nearly every aspect of daily life, but Times journalists are here to keep you informed and connected from home. Below is a selection of our live events this week (all times are Eastern). You can find the full calendar here.Wednesday at 9 p.m. on ZoomA Moment of CalmJewel has always been a social-distancing queen. The yodeling surfer girl of the ’90s pop scene grew up in the Alaska wilderness, on an 800-acre homestead miles from the nearest town. And Jewel, a four-time Grammy nominee, knows a thing or two about coping with jarring circumstances: In the span of just a few years in the mid-’90s, she went from living in her van and singing in coffee shops to releasing a mega-platinum album, selling out concerts and gracing the cover of Rolling Stone.Her voice — by turns “a sultry alto, a clear soprano, a country whoop, a little-girl whisper or a speedy yodel” — her “lucid and articulate” lyrics and her “giggly, good-natured stage presence” endeared her to The New York Times’s pop music critic Jon Pareles. “She can spin out metaphors, tell unadorned stories or come up with choruses like ‘I’m sensitive and I’d like to stay that way,’” he wrote in 1996.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyNow decades into an enormously successful career as a musician, actress and writer, Jewel has also become an advocate for mental health. She wrote about her own struggles in her 2015 memoir, “Never Broken: Songs Are Only Half the Story,” and is a founder of the Never Broken initiative, which provides people struggling with anxiety with a road map to a happier, healthier and more resilient life.This week, she joins Joanna Nikas, a writer and editor for The Times’s Styles section, for a candid conversation about caring for yourself. She will share personal stories, lead a guided meditation and perform music from her forthcoming album.
